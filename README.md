# About

This is a work-in-progress emulator for the 8 Bit Pipelined CPU by James Sharman written in Rust.  
You can find the real hardware implementation of the CPU on James Sharmans YouTube channel:

Note that while the hardware itself is not finalized, the emulator won't be either. All opcodes currently supported are subject to change.  
Once James has finished implementing the VGA circuit, that too will be added to the emulator.  
Final goal of the emulator is to allow development and usage of software for the real hardware without having to build it yourself.
